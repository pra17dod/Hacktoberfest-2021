#### Step3: Clone repository
You can clone the repository by clicking the drop down button and copy the URL

![clone.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631849736400/CHXSCwT5f.png)

```
git clone "copied url"
``` 
For e.g. 

```
git clone "https://github.com/naveeramesh/DSA-Bootcamp-Java.git"
``` 
Here, DSA-Bootcamp is the name of the original  repository now it is locally cloned to your device.
### Step 3: Create branch
Now, you have to create your own branch, At the very first step move to your cloned folder

```
cd DSA-Bootcamp-Java
``` 
The DSA-Bootcamp-Java is your folder name.
Now create a branch using the git checkout command:
 
```
git checkout -b add "branch name"

``` 

E.g.
```
git checkout -b new_branch

``` 
Here the **new branch** is the name of the branch you can give any name it is up to you.
### Step 4: Commit
Now, you can make necessary changes, e.g. You can create a folder called Blog/README.md and insert some text, code and save the file, Now move back to the terminal and give the command

```
git status
``` 
Now, it list out the changes you have made.
```
git add .
```
This command helps to add all the changes you have made
```
git commit -m "first commit"
```
This command helps you to commit all the changes you have made to the file, It is not necessary you should name is as **first commit** you can also name it as 
```
git commit -m "new_branch - readme"
``` 
The ** new branch ** represents your branch name and ** readme ** is the name of your file.
### Step 5: Push Changes
Until now the changes have not added to the GitHub repository,
```
git push -u origin <add-your-branch-name>

```
E.g.
```
git push -u origin new_branch

```
### Step 6: Submit your changes for review
This is the step where you inform the owner of the repo to accept the changes, which is called PR - Pull request, After pushing the changes move to your cloned repo and refresh the page

![pr.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631850960606/VXtpDYFFe.png)
